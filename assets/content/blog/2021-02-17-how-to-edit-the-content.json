They’ll be added to a pull request by Netlify CMS that you merge in the next step by saving.\n3. **Save your changes:** After you have edited the content on the site, you need to save. This will trigger Netlify CMS to merge the PR to the main branch (it will show up in your git log).\n4. **Grab a coffee:** After saving, you have to wait for Netlify to build your main branch (which probably takes 2-5 minutes, depending on your setup). If you’re a control-freak, login to Netlify to watch your build run and see when it is published. You can also publish older commits from there."
